# neuropythy #######################################################################################
A neuroscience library for Python, intended to complement the existing nibabel library.

For additional documentation, in particular usage documentation, see
[the neuropythy wiki](https://github.com/noahbenson/neuropythy/wiki) and
[the OSF wiki](https://osf.io/knb5g/wiki/home/) for
[Benson and Winawer, (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1101/325597).

## Author ##########################################################################################
Noah C. Benson &lt;<nben@nyu.edu>&gt;

## Installation ####################################################################################

The neuropythy library is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/neuropythy) and can be
installed via pip:

```bash
pip install neuropythy
```

The dependencies (below) should be installed auotmatically. Alternately, you can check out this
github repository and run setuptools:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/noahbenson/neuropythy
# Enter the repo directory
cd neuropythy
# setup the submodules
git submodule init && git submodule update
# Install the library
python setup.py install

```

## Dependencies ####################################################################################

The neuropythy library depends on a few other libraries, all freely available:
 * [numpy](http://numpy.scipy.org/) &ge; 1.13.0
 * [scipy](http://www.scipy.org/) &ge; 1.1.0
 * [nibabel](https://github.com/nipy/nibabel) &ge; 2.0
 * [pyrsistent](https://github.com/tobgu/pyrsistent) &ge; 0.11.0
 * [pimms](https://github.com/noahbenson/pimms) &ge; 0.3.18
 * [pint](https://github.com/hgrecco/pint) &ge; 0.7.0
 * [py4j](https://www.py4j.org/) &ge; 0.10

These libaries should be installed automatically for you if you use pip or setuptools (see above),
and they must be found on your PYTHONPATH in order to use neuropythy.

### Optional Dependencies

All optional dependencies are included in the `requirements-dev.txt` file in the neuropythy
repository root. 

 * **[s3fs &ge; 0.1.5](https://github.com/dask/s3fs)**. The HCP dataset can be accessed
   automatically using neuropythy's hcp_subject() function. If configured correctly (see below),
   neuropythy will silently download the relevant HCP data from its Amazon S3 bucket as it is
   requested. Doing this requires the s3fs library.
 * **[h5py &ge; 2.8.0](https://github.com/h5py/h5py)**. The h5py file is used to import the HCP 
   retinotopy data if it is found or configured for automatic-downloading (see below).
 * **[matplotlib &ge; 1.5.3](http://matplitlib.org/)**. A few functions for plotting cortical maps
   are defined in the neuropythy.graphics package. These are not defined if matplotlib is not
   imported successfully. The primary interface to this functionality is the
   `neuropythy.cortex_plot` as well as some helper functions and colormaps.
 * **[ipyvolume &ge; 0.5.1](https://github.com/maartenbreddels/ipyvolume)**. If you wish to make 3D
   graphics plots, you will need to install and use the `ipyvolume` library. The neuropythy function
   `neuropythy.cortex_plot` will handle most of the details, assuming you have `ipyvolume`
   installed.
 * **[Java &ge; 1.8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)**.
   The registration algorithm employed by the register_retinotopy command is performed by
   a Java library embedded in the neuropythy Python library. This library is the
   [nben](https://github.com/noahbenson/nben) library, and is included as a submodule of this
   GitHub repository, found in neuropythy/lib/nben; a standalone jar-file is also distributed as
   part of the PyPI neuropythy distribution. However, in order for the Py4j library, which allows
   Python to execute Java routines, to use this jar-file, you must have a working version of Java
   installed; accordingly, the register_retinotopy command is only available if you have Java
   installed and working. For help getting Java configured to work with Py4j, see the
   [Py4j installation page](https://www.py4j.org/install.html).

### Python Version #################################################################################

Neuropythy is compatible with both Python 3. It was deleveloped under 2.7 but is no longer
officially supported for Python 2. It is now used primarily with Python 3.6.

## Configuration ###################################################################################

Neuropythy is most useful when it knows where to find your FreeSurfer subject data or where you want
it to store datasets or Human Connectome Project files. These configuration items can be set in a
number of ways:
* On startup, neuropythy looks for a file `~/.npythyrc` (though this file name may be changed by
  setting the `NPYTHYRC` environment variable). The contents of this file should be a JSON
  dictionary with configurable variables (such as `"freesurfer_subject_paths"`) as the keys. An
  example configuration file:
  ```json
  {"freesurfer_subject_paths": "/Volumes/server/Freesurfer_subjects",
   "data_cache_root":          "~/Temp/npythy_cache",
   "hcp_subject_paths":        "/Volumes/server/Projects/HCP/subjects",
   "hcp_auto_download":        true,
   "hcp_credentials":          "~/.hcp-passwd"}
  ```
* Each config variable in the `NPYTHYRC` file may be overrided using an associated environment
  variable. Usually the environment variable names are either the config variables in uppercase or
  `NPYTHY_` + the variable in uppercase: `NPYTHY_DATA_CACHE_ROOT`, `HCP_CREDENTIALS`,
  `HCP_AUTO_DOWNLOAD`. The `SUBJECTS_DIR` environment is used for the FreeSurfer subject paths, and
  the `HCP_SUBJECTS_DIR` variable is used for the HCP subject paths (both may be :-separated lists
  of directories).
* The config items may be retrieved and set directly using `neuropythy.config`. Values that are set
  in this way override the `NPYTHYRC` file and all environment variables. For example:
  ```python
  import neuropythy as ny
  ny.config['data_cache_root']
  #=> '/Users/nben/Temp/npythy_cache'
  ny.config['data_cache_root'] = '~/Documents/npythy_data'
  ny.config['data_cache_root']
  #=> '/Users/nben/Documents/npythy_data'
  ```

## Human Connectome Project Integration ############################################################

The neuropythy library is capable of automatically integrating with the Human Connectome Project's
Amazon S3 bucket. Neuropythy will present you with nested data structures representing individual
HCP subjects and will silently download the relevant structure files as they are requested. To
configure this behavior, follow these steps:
* Make a directory somewhere to store the HCP subjects that are downloaded. The subjects won't be
  downloaded all at once, but it will drastically speed up future loading of subjects if you cache
  them on your local filesystem.
* **Sign up for an HCP account.** You can do this at the [HCP's database
  page](https://db.humanconnectome.org/).
* Once you have an account, log into the database; near the top of the initial splash page is a cell
  titles "WU-Minn HCP Data - 1200 Subjects" and inside this cell is a button for activating Amazon
  S3 Access. When you activate this feature, you will be given an amazon "Key" and "Secret".
* Copy and paste your key and secret into a file `~/.hcp-passwd` such that the contents are your key
  followed by a colon followed by your secret, e.g., `mys3key:mys3secret`.
* You should then make sure that the configuration variable `"hcp_credentials"` is set to
  `"~/.hcp-passwd"` in your `~/.npythyrc` file (see Configuration, above). Additionally, set the
  `"hcp_auto_download"` value is set to `true`, and set the `"hcp_auto_path"` variable to the
  directory in which you plan to store the HCP subject data.
  
Note that the above steps will additionally enable auto-downloading of the retinotopic mapping
database; if you are only interested in the structural data, you can set the `"hcp_auto_download"`
variable to `"structure"`. If you do enable auto-downloading of the retinotopic maps, then the first
time you examine an HCP subject, neuropythy will have to download the retinotopy database files,
which are approximately 1 GB; it may appear as if neuropythy has frozen during this time, but it is
probably just due to the download. Generally speaking, if your internet connection is relatively
fast, you should not notice significant delays from downloading the HCP strucutral data otherwise.

For more information about using the HCP module of neuropythy, see
[this page](https://noahbenson.github.io/HCP-and-Neuropythy/).

Additional notes:
* Currently, only `'lowres-prf_*'` properties are available via neuropythy. The `'lowres-'` refers
  to the fact that the pRF models were solved on the HCP fs_LR32k mesh rather than the
  higher-resolution 59k mesh. Higher resolution solutions being available in the near future in a
  new release of neuropythy and will be named `'prf_*'`, e.g., `'prf_polar_angle'`.
* Low resolution and higher resolution pRF solutions are very similar; there is no need to be
  concerned that the low-resolution pRF solutions are broadly missing the mark with respect to
  the retinotopic maps of subjects.
* If you enable pythons `logging` module to print info-level messages, then neuropythy will inform
  you whenever it is about to download a large file; it does not print messages for the smaller
  files that typically take only a few seconds to download. To configure this, use:
  ```python
  import logging
  logging.getLogger().setLevel(logging.INFO)
  ```

## Builtin Datasets ################################################################################

Neuropythy now comes with support for builtin datasets. These datasets are downloaded when they are
first requested, and are only re-downloaded if necessary; note that if you have configured
neuropythy's `"data_cache_root"` configuration variable (see Configuration, above), then the data
will be downloaded to a temporary directory that is deleted when Python exits.

Currently, there is only one builtin dataset (not including the Human Connectome Project dataset,
above), and that is the dataset from [Benson and Winawer (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1101/325597). To
access this dataset:

```python
import neuropythy as ny
subs = ny.data['benson_winawer_2018'].subjects
sorted(subs.keys())
#=> ['S1201', 'S1202', 'S1203', 'S1204', 'S1205', 'S1206', 'S1207', 'S1208', 'fsaverage']
subs['S1201']
#=> Subject(<S1201>,
#=>         <'/Users/nben/Temp/npythy_cache/benson_winawer_2018/freesurfer_subjects/S1201'>)
subs['S1201'].lh.prop('prf_polar_angle')
#=> array([118.811386, 118.80122 , 120.842255, ..., -14.08387 , -62.615746, -32.82376],
#=>       dtype=float32)
```

See also `help(ny.data['benson_winawer_2018'])` or `print(ny.data['benson_winawer_2018'].__doc__)`.

## Commands ########################################################################################

Currently Neuropythy is undergoing rapid development, but to get started, the neuropythy.commands
package contains functions that run command-interfaces for the various routines included.  Any of
these commands may be invoked by calling Neuropythy's main function and passing the name of the
command as the first argument followed by any additional command arguments. The argument --help may
be passed for further information about each command.

 * **surface_to_image**. This command projects data on the cortical surface into a volume the same
   orientation as the subject's mri/orig.mgz file. The algorithm used tends to be much cleaner than
   that used by FreeSurfer's mri_surf2vol.
 * **atlas**. This command is similar to the (now deprecated)
   [nben/occipital_atlas](https://hub.docker.com/r/nben/occipital_atlas) docker/command, which
   applies both the Wang et al. (2015) and Benson et al. (2014) atlases to the cortical surface of
   a subject. The `atlas` command is similar but uses a more updated version of the Benson-2014
   atlas and is more flexible than `occipital_atlas` or the `benson14_retinotopy` command (below).
   Old versions (1.0, 2.0, 2.1, 2.5, 3.0) of the Benson-2014 atlas may be applied to a subject using
   this command as well.
 * **benson14_retinotopy**. This command applies the anatomically-defined template of retinotopy
   described by Benson *et al.* (2014; see **References** below) to a subject. Note that the
   template applied is not actually the template shown in the paper but is a similar updated
   version.
 * **register_retinotopy**. This command fits a retinotopic model of V1, V2, and V3 to retinotopy
   data for a subject and saves the predicted retinotopic maps that result. Running this command
   requires some retinotopic measurements that have already been transferred to the subject's
   FreeSurfer surface. These files can either be specified on the command line (see the
   `register_retinotopy --help` documentation) or placed in the subject's `surf/` directory and
   named as follows:
    * lh.prf_angle.mgz (subject's LH polar angle, 0-180 degrees refers to UVM -> RHM -> LVM)
    * rh.prf_angle.mgz (subject's RH polar angle, 0-180 degrees refers to UVM -> LHM -> RVM)
    * lh.prf_eccen.mgz (subject's LH eccentricity, in degrees)
    * rh.prf_eccen.mgz (subject's RH eccentricity, in degrees)
    * lh.prf_vexpl.mgz (the varaince explained of each vertex's pRF solution for the LH; 0-1 values)
    * rh.prf_vexpl.mgz (the varaince explained of each vertex's pRF solution for the RH; 0-1 values)

   To be clear, both the left and right hemispheres' angle files should specify the polar angle in
   positive degrees; for the right hemisphere, positive refers to the left visual hemi-field; for
   the left hemisphere, positive values refer to the right visual hemi-field. In both cases, 0
   represents the upper vertical meridian and 180 represents the lower vertical meridian. Each MGZ
   file should contain a 1x1xn (or 1x1x1xn) volume where n is the number of vertices in the relevant
   hemisphere and the vertex ordering is that used by FreeSurfer.
   

If neuropythy is installed on your machine, then you can execute a command like so:

```bash
> python -m neuropythy surface_to_image --help
> python -m neuropythy atlas --verbose bert
```


## Docker ##########################################################################################

There is a Docker containing Neuropythy that can be used to run the Neuropythy commands quite easily
without installing Neuropythy itself. If you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed, you
can use Neuropythy as follows:

```bash
# If your FreeSurfer subject's directory is /data/subjects and you want to
# apply the Benson2014 template to a subject bert:
docker run -ti --rm -v /data/subjects:/subjects nben/neuropythy \
           atlas --verbose bert
```

The docker can now also be used to start a notebook server; you can either build this yourself
(in which case any local changes to the neuropythy code will be included) using `docker-compose` or
you may use the `nben/neuropythy` docker on docker-hub.

### Using `docker-compose`

To build the docker image locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/noahbenson/neuropythy
cd neuropythy
# This command will take some time to build the VM;
docker-compose build
# This will start the notebook server (and will build
# the docker first if you haven't run the above
# command). Note, however, that this command won't
# rebuild the container if you have local changes.
docker-compose up
```

The above instructions will create a notebook server running on port 8888; to change this, you can
either edit the `docker-compose.yml` file or instead use `docker-compose run`:

```bash
docker-compose run -p 8888:8080 neuropythy notebook
```

Assuming that your FreeSurfer subjects directory and your HCP subject directory, if any, are set via
the `SUBJECTS_DIR` and `HCP_SUBJECTS_DIR` environment variables, then these directories will be
available inside the docker VM in `/data/freesurfer_subjects` and `/data/hcp/subjects`.
Additionally, your `NPYTHY_DATA_CACHE_ROOT`, `HCP_CREDENTIALS`, `HCP_AUTO_DOWNLOAD` and other
environment variables will be forwarded to neuropythy. However, note that if your `HCP_CREDENTIALS`
variable is a file, you will need to put the literal credentials in the variable instead as the
docker image cannot read from your file.

### Using `nben/neuropythy` from Docker Hub

To run the notebook server using the prepared docker-image:

```bash
# fetch the docker:
docker pull nben/neuropythy:latest
# run the notebook server
docker run -it \
           -v "$SUBJECTS_DIR:/data/freesurfer_subjects" \
           -v "$HCP_SUBJECTS_DIR:/data/hcp/subjects" \
           -p 8888:8888 \
       nben/neuropythy notebook
```

Note that the lines starting with `-v` can each be omitted if you don't want to mount your subject
directories inside the docker and/or if you don't have HCP/FreeSurfer subjects.
